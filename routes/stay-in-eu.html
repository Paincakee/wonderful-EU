            why remaining part of the EU is beneficial:
        </h2>
        <p>
            <b>Economic Stability:</b> Membership in the EU provides access to a vast and prosperous market, offering opportunities for businesses to expand their operations and create jobs. The EU's economic integration fosters stability, resilience, and growth, shielding member states from global economic downturns and uncertainties.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Political Influence:</b> As a member of the EU, the Netherlands has a seat at the table in shaping the future of Europe and the world. By working together with other member states, the Netherlands can amplify its voice on the international stage, advocate for its interests, and address global challenges such as climate change, migration, and security.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Shared Values and Solidarity:</b> The EU is founded on principles of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, promoting peace, stability, and cooperation among its member states. By standing together with fellow European nations, the Netherlands demonstrates its commitment to these shared values and reinforces solidarity in times of crisis.
