        <h2>Brief History</h2>
        <p>
            The story of the European Union begins amidst the rubble of World War II.
            In the aftermath of the conflict that ravaged the continent, European leaders envisioned a future where unity would replace division,
            and cooperation would triumph over conflict. In 1951, the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was formed,
            marking the first step towards economic integration among six founding nations: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.

            As the years progressed, the desire for deeper cooperation grew stronger.
            In 1957, the Treaty of Rome established the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM),
            laying the groundwork for a common market and fostering economic growth across member states.

            Through subsequent treaties and agreements, the EU expanded both in size and scope, welcoming new members and embracing new responsibilities.
            Today, the EU comprises 27 member states, united by shared values and a commitment to a brighter future.
