    <h2>How does it work??</h2>
    <h3>
        At the heart of the EU's functioning lies a delicate balance of institutions and mechanisms
        designed to promote cooperation and decision-making among member states. The key institutions include:
    </h3>
    <p>
        The European Commission: The executive branch of the EU responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, and upholding the EU's treaties.
    </p>
    <p>
        The European Parliament: The legislative body directly elected by EU citizens, representing their interests and playing a crucial role in shaping EU policies.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Council of the European Union: Comprised of government ministers from each member state, the Council shares legislative and decision-making authority with the European Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
        The European Council: Consisting of the heads of state or government of EU member states, the European Council provides strategic direction and sets the EU's political agenda.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Court of Justice of the European Union: Ensures the uniform interpretation and application of EU law, safeguarding the rights and interests of EU citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through a system of checks and balances, these institutions work together to formulate policies, enact legislation, and address the challenges facing Europe and its citizens.
